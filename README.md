# Happiness Project

## Purpose
Most, if not all, people want to be happy. I started exploring happiness for countries after remembering when I used to analyze country competitiveness.

This project aims to analyze how happy people across different countries and if the factors are different. Eventually, I want to compare happiness with the global competitiveness reports from the WEC.
