# Happiness Project

## Purpose
Most, if not all, people want to be happy. I started exploring happiness for countries after remembering when I used to analyze country competitiveness.

This project aims to analyze how happy people across different countries and if the factors are different. Eventually, I want to compare happiness with national economic indicators or statisitics, specifically for Canada. I tried to use the Global Competitiveness reports from the WEC, but they were a headache to deal with so I am switching gears to Canada Stats. This is still a work in progress though.

## Process
Explored the data and read the supplementary data reports to better understand the data. Replaced most of the nulls with mean and median values.
